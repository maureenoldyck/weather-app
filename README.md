# Weather App 🌤

For this exercise we had to create a weather app. We had to use our recent gained knowledge about API's to fetch weather data of an user entered city. It was a fun challenge that made us prepared on which clothes to wear in the coming days.

## ☔  Tools used 
- Visual Studio Code 
- Languages: HTML, CSS, JS
- Chart.JS
- Markdown
- Google, our best friend
- Flaticon.com, for icons
- Fontawesome for icons
- OpenWeather for API
- Google Fonts
- Blood, sweat and tears


## ⚡️ Mission Objectives
In this challenge you will use and consolidate your knowledge on:

* A typical AJAX flow: send asynchronous requests to a remote server and process the results
* DOM manipulation: changing the DOM based on the results of the AJAX requests
* Learn to aggregate and parse data fetched from an api


## 🌞 Must Have Features 
* In the home page the user can enter the city of his/her choice (think of the right HTML elements here)
* On clicking the SUBMIT button or pressing ENTER the application will display the weather for the next 5 days
* The application must be responsive and mobile friendly
  

##  🌈 Result 
### - [weather-app](https://maureenoldyck.github.io/weather-app/ "Weather App")
 

  
## 🐞 Bugs in my app

- The graph shows the hours where the user is located, not where the searched city is located. (Nothing I can change about this at the moment as this is how I get the data from the openWeather API).
